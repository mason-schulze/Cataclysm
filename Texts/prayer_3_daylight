Daylight

There are many dark and unwholesome places beneath the world where Minariel's
benevolence does not reach. Many of them are shrouded in near-eternal darkness,
making them difficult for the faithful to traverse. But fear not! The Guardian
of the Eternal Flame will provide for the needs of thine eyes. Mantra:

"Torrivel Minariel. Om Farzi yolk bannadu kazgatnik yamir.
... Nath quendi nollorthiment hellcragze deshnell."

And She will crown thine head in the smokeless flame of the sun.
