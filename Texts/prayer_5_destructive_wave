Destructive Wave

Favored Paladins of Minariel should not fear the depredations of swarms of
enemies, for Her destructive might shall rain ruin on those who would assault
Her envoys. Mantra:

"Om Excarith! Fazzaad! ... Li!"

The resultant wave of repulsive force will be more than enough to subdue all but
the toughest enemies.
