Divine Sense

Request that Minariel lend you the aid of a fragment of Her boundless wisdom and
infinite sight. Keeps the faithful from harm by warning them of possible
dangers. Mantra:

"O, Minariel! Hasta vannest entathia farrinel dost?
Yannaba Jandarase?
Leng aethblick rind nell!"

If all is well, Minariel will show Her faithful the rough locations of dangerous
objects and beings.
