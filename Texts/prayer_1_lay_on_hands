Lay On Hands

The first prayer taught to any decent paladin of Minariel. The paladin must
touch the creature to be healed (even if that is themself), while incanting the
following mantra:

"Om fellimath, Om tintagel, Om delzimeer!
O, Minariel! Sadat varli incoginae!"

If the paladin be worthy, the creature will be healed.
