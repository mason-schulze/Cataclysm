Tuesday.

Warm rain.

Success! Have met a party of adventurers in tavern today.

We have:
	Dwarf who seems rather handy with an axe by the name Grindvolk.
	Elf sorceress. Didn't catch name.
	Dragonborn named Smevorell. Supposedly the best marksman this side of
		Gastbane. Will believe when I see it.
	Some thing that calls itself Vrell in a cloak and mask. Quiet. Keeps to
		his/her self.
