Tuesday.

Freezing. Just freezing. I hate this mountain.

Have made it to the supposed dragon lair.

Been tardy with journal again. Ooops.

Have been harried by stupid Kobolds with too much attitude.

Kobold presence good: means dragon hoard is likely here. Kobold presence bad;
means dragon is probably here too.

Fuck.
