Turn Undead

Disgusting abomination and perversions of life can be hard to put to rest.
Merely destroying their physical forms is often not enough. But the wielder of
the Ivory Staff knows ends of all things, and allows her followers to put undead
on a path to final dissolution. Mantra:

"Oth Necronos! Te vatch varanell ni Minariel!"

This discomfits the undead, and makes them vulnerable.
